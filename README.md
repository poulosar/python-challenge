# python-challenge
Required to run:
Python v. 3.7.6 or later (older versions may work but have not been tested)

This repository consists of two programs: 1. PyBank and 2. PyPol

PyBank was created to read and analyze a simple company budget csv file. The results of these calcuations will be output in terminal as well as within a text file. This file is output to "python-challenge/PyBank/Analysis/data_analysis.txt".  The goal is to find 5 specific metrics:
  1. Total months in the data set
  2. Net total amount of profit or loss
  3. The average of change in profit or loss
  4. Greatest increase in profits
  5. Greatest decrease in profits



PyPol was created to read and analyze a local municipalities voter data to modernize the vote counting process. Results will be sent to "python-challenge/PyPol/Analysis/data_analysis.txt". The goal of the program is to return the following questions, print to terminal and write results to a text file.
  1. Total votes cast
  2. List of candidates who received a vote
  3. Percentage of vote per candidate
  4. Total votes per candidate
  5. Winner of popular vote election

Both programs should work with any data set that follows the same formatting rules of the csv files located in the resource folder of the respective program.

Any questions, concerns, or suggestions can be submitted to poulosar@gmail.com - I will try my best to respond or resolve issues that arise.

Thanks for reading!
